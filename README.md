  ## Installation
  Unfortunally, more work is required to make this code work. I am having issues with the path to the weatherService.js file. I tried several ways to make it work but i ran out of time and was not able to make it work. I will have to come back and fix this. 
  ## Usage
  Once code is fixed, you can run the application to forcast the weather to an specific city you are planning to visit.
